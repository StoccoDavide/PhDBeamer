\begin{frame}{Introduction and Motivation}{Solution Technique}
  How can we improve the solution of \acp{DAE}?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Complicated and abstract index concepts and reduction techniques arose over the years to ease the solution process.
    \item Most of existing tools are based on \textbf{numerical} or \textbf{structural analysis} techniques.
    \item In the last decades, \textbf{symbolic computation} has reached a high level of maturity \dots \\
    \dots but it is not as widely used as one might expect.
