\begin{frame}{Q1 -- Gerdts}
  Is there a connection between the tractability index and the construction of projectors therein and the procedure using LU decompositions in Chapter 4?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Q2 -- Gerdts}
  How does the developed symbolic factorization method compare to GENDA by Mehrmann/Kunkel in view of CPU times?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Q3 -- Gerdts}
  The minimum degree pivoting strategy apperantly worked for the examples in the thesis. In general, I assume, it cannot guarantee that all pivots are non-zero during evaluation. If a zero pivot is detected for a specific example, how would you proceed with the symbolic factorization?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Q4 -- Gerdts}
  Is it necessary to reduce to index-0 or would it be sufficient to reduce to index-1 and use a standard integrator like DASSL, RADAUIIA?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Q1 -- Mazzia}
  Usually, there is no information related to all initial conditions, which must be calculated consistently. Do you think the index reduction strategy can be used to calculate consistent initial values?

  How does the developed symbolic factorization method compare to GENDA by Mehrmann/Kunkel in view of CPU times?
